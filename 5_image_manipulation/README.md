## Part 1 - Masking

### Objective

The purpose of `masking.py` is to isolate all the pixels of a RGB image equal / hifher / lower to a given threshold and create a mask. This mask will be used to create the masked version of RGB image. In this code, we used a RGB color threshold of `(128, 128, 128)` and isolated all the pixels with a RGB value higher than this threshold.

### Running the Code

There are two ways to run the code:
1. Run `python masking.py` to check your results.
2. Run the first chunk of `image_manipulation.ipynb`

## Part 2 - Statistics 

### Objective

In this exercise, you first need to calculate the channel wise mean and standard deviations of a list 
of images in `statistics.py`. 

### Details

The purpose of `statistics.py` is to calcualte and output the channel wise mean and standard deviation over a list of images. 

### Running the Code

There are two ways to run the code:
1. Run `python statistics.py` to check your results.
2. Run the second chunk of `image_manipulation.ipynb`
